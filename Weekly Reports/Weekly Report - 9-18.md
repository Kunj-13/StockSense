# Team Report

## Subsection 1: What We Did From Last Section
N/A – it is week 1.

## Subsection 2: What We Did
This week, we worked on figuring out who is responsible for each part of the project:

- **Navid and Kunj**: Working on the machine learning aspects with the LLM (Language Model).
- **Krish and Sahil**: Focusing on the backend development.
- **Tahira and [Other Group Member]**: Responsible for the frontend of the project.

### Where We Had Troubles:
- Not everybody shows up to our section in person, and some are only on Zoom. This has led to slight communication issues, but we expect this to be resolved by next week.

## Subsection 3: Goals for the Following Weeks
- Improve our method of communication and ensure everyone is on the same page.
- For the machine learning and backend team, learn more about what an LLM is and how to create one.
- For the frontend team, figure out the best approach to develop the frontend of the project.
- Identify where to obtain Powell's speeches.
- Create either a web scraper tool or download PDFs of the speeches.
- Convert the PDFs of the speeches into a format suitable for the LLM.

### Kunj 

I will mainly work on the machine-learning aspect with Navid for the project. For this week, I have just started going through different materials and researching what machine-learning models we will use. Not just that but also going through videos and articles to get a grasp of the project and finalize the features we would like our project to have so we can actually get started on working on the project next week.


### Sahil
I've been watching videos to figure out where to get a good dataset that we can easily integrate into the code. I’ve also been checking out which machine learning model and LLM would work best for this project, and looking into the features we’ll need to add. Hopefully, I’ll be able to start coding next week.

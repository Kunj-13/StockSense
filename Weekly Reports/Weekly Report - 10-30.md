# Team Report

# Project Update

## Subsection 1: What We Did Last Week
- Converted the documents to JSON format with embeddings.
- Inserted the documents into the vector database.
- Hopefully, have a simple demo of the project without all of the data, in a simple command line interface, to show the front-end team. If time does not permit, this will be a goal for next week.
- Meet more often as a team, as we're still slacking on that a bit.

## Subsection 2: What We Did
- **Navid and Kunj (Machine Learning):** Converted the documents into JSON format to be inserted into the vector database and started working on the actual outputs and giving the output context.
- **Krish and Sahil (Back-End):** Input all of the documents into the vector database and helped the machine learning team with the bot outputs, implementing the semantic search.
- **Tahira and Neville (Front-End):** Got prototype AI chatboxes running and are testing API calls. Holding off on adding in-depth interactivity until the AI chatbox works properly and looks better. Basic layout is in place. Front-end work will be combined if everything functions correctly.

### Troubles
- No major issues this week, but the front end is further along than the back-end and machine learning teams in making API calls.

## Subsection 3: What We Will Do Next
- Create a file for the API calls so the front end can figure out what else needs to be done.
- Alter the front end to fully integrate the bot.
- Hopefully, have a simple demo of the project without all of the data, in a simple command line interface, to show the front-end team. If time does not permit, this will be a goal for next week.
- Meet more often as a team, as we're still slacking on that a bit.
- Realistically, we just need to work on these same goals again.


# Individual Report


## Kunj 

## Subsection 1
- It would be great to start working with the backend team to hopefully try to develop basic API calls for querying the vector database using the embeddings by next week.
- Also, work on finalizing a simple demo to show to the frontend team that truly displays all of our features.
- It would be great for Navid and I to convert all of those embedded CSV files we made into JSON files, which we can use for the vector database.

## Subsection 2
- Worked with Navid on converting the embeddings into JSON files.
- Worked with Krish to finish the semantic search.
- Started working on implementing the semantic search into the bot outputs.

## Subsection 3
- It would be great to start working with the backend team to hopefully try to develop basic API calls for querying the vector database using the embeddings by next week.
- Also, work on finalizing a simple demo to show to the frontend team that truly displays all of our features.
- These goals are about the same as last time since the machine learning team is running a bit behind schedule.


## Sahil
## Subsection 1
- Start implementing the Fed speeches.
- Started figuring out what the frontend is going to look like.
- Finish setting up the database.

## Subsection 2
- Worked with Krish on making the semantic search fully functional.
- Uploaded documents into the vector database.

## Subsection 3
- Figure out how to configure the outputs of the bot into JSON so the front end can use it.
- Help finish the bot output with Navid and Kunj.


## Tahira
### Subsection 1: 

This week:

I was working on data visualization libray Chart.js for displaying stock trends and analysis, now I realized the backend is not created for charts. So my week was not productive, but I learn something that maybe useful in the future. Setting up react is not a big job, but it took me days to understand how to build it.

### Subsection 2:

Next weeks Goal:

Modify the react to give final touches. Not much left to do.



### Krish

## Subsection 1
- Learned more about OpenAI API and how we will be using it to train our models.
- Installed some of the dependencies for libraries we will be using in the backend.
- Configured VSCode to be able to use it with the GitHub repository.
- Watched more videos on JSON and how to format data.

## Subsection 2
- Uploaded documents into the vector database.
- Finished the semantic search.
- Helping the machine learning team with the bot outputs.

## Subsection 3
- I want to coordinate with the group and make sure we are all on the same page for how we will push commits to the repository without screwing up each other's work.
- Figure out how to configure the outputs of the bot into JSON so the front end can use it.


### Navid Hoque

## Subsection 1: Last Weekâ€™s Goals
- Work with Kunj and the back-end team to try and have a very simple demo to show the front-end team how the chatbot works, and from there assist with anything we can.
- Since the machine learning team is almost done with their parts of the project, we will most likely help the back-end teams with their tasks.
- Look into how to perform a semantic search and use the chatbot to output the results.

## Subsection 2: What We Did
- Converted all embeddings into JSON format.
- Started working on integrating semantic search into the bot so we can get a good output from the AI chatbot.

## Subsection 3: Plans and Goals
- Work with Kunj and the back-end team to try and have a very simple demo to show the front-end team how the chatbot works, and from there assist with anything we can.
- Since the machine learning team is almost done with their parts of the project, we will most likely help the back-end teams with their tasks.
- Finish the semantic search and use the chatbot to output the results.
- Still working on these same goals as last week.


### Neville

## Last Week's Goals:
- Unfortunately, not much tangible results have come out of what I did this week (as in postable code). I did do more looking around and research around some of these topics.
- I have gotten more understanding of how React interacts with JavaScript/JSX, and how it works in a hierarchial sense. It's still quite a bit to grasp though.
- Since the detail about using JSON has been solidified, I am able to source help that gives me an idea of how to implement displaying output. Basically, I can focus on reading our JSON outputs and rendering it.
- Me and Tahira have gotten a clearer idea of where to start with our actual app. Well, it's clearer than last week. It still needs ironing out. We do have another prototype in the works.
  
## This Week's Summary and Status:
- We did good stuff this week. We got a nice looking layout going, and theoretically can save chat history (this is slightly bugged, I opened an issue about it).
- I figured out how to more easily port my program. I was actually able to upload my test file to the GitHub thanks to this. I was also able to have Tahira run it and have the code, so we can add to it now.
- I mostly used AI to build the CSS and some of the features, but I also added some stuff myself. I'm so proud.
- Being able to port it had me realize that our separate-then-combine approach might actually work pretty well. As long as we work on allowing the pieces to easily recombine, or have a template to work with, it should be fine.

## Plans And Goals:
- I really really really need to test API calls more. It's the basis of our program, it must work!
- The back-end team is still working on our economically minded AI. I'll probably try working on bug fixes or layout while they're getting that ready.
- I'm satisfied with what I showed this week, but I will always say anyway that we should meet more.
- I think we clarified most of the details, but I still should do it more. It's difficult to change the layout or try to get it to look how I want it, HTML/JS is just odd and confusing sometimes.
- Find a good tester or React App development environment, perhaps. It's for an assignment coming up, and I am still a bit worried about if I am working with limited tools.
- Rewatch the videos we were sent. I watched them before, and they were good but the frontend stuff was in Python. Maybe I can reglean something with another look at it?

### Communication Rules
We will mainly communicate using Teams for discussions and face-to-face meetings
alongside Discord for regular check-ins/help with the project. Phone calls will be used for
urgent help with the project. Each team member must reply to text/phone calls in a
timely manner and within 12 hours.

## Product Description
The StockSense LLM is an AI chatbot that will be fed context from Federal Reserve speeches and stock data, most likely from yfinance and other APIs. The plan is to also incorporate stock option data to provide better advice on the market and guidance on which options to play, depending on whether the market is bullish or bearish, and how to trade accordingly. It will be an interactive bot that will be useful for both new and seasoned traders and may have other applications as well.

### Major Features to be Implemented:
- Creating an interactive experience capable of handling multiple requests.
- Including context based on Federal Reserve speeches.
- Access to current and past stock data.
- Knowledge of option data, including all of the Greeks.

### Stretch Goals to Potentially be Implemented:
- Developing a financial glossary to improve the chatbot's understanding of the data it receives.
- Performing sentiment analysis on current and past news articles to provide a more comprehensive knowledge base for the LLM.

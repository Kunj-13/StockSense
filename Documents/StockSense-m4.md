## Software Architecture

### Major Software Components
1. Front-end Application
  - Functionality: User interface for interacting with the chatbot. It displays stock data, insights, and allows users to input queries.
  - Technologies: React or Vue.js for building responsive interfaces.
2. Chatbot Engine
  - Functionality: Processes user queries, generates responses using an LLM, and integrates market analysis insights. It can handle context from Federal Reserve speeches and respond with tailored advice.
  - Technologies: OpenAI API for LLM capabilities
3. Data Processing Module
  - Functionality: Fetches and processes stock market data, Federal Reserve speeches, and options data from various APIs. This module also implements algorithms for market analysis.
  - Technologies: Python for data processing and analysis, using libraries like Pandas and NumPy.
4. Vector Database
  - Functionality: Stores vector embeddings for stock data, Federal Reserve speeches, and user interactions. This enables fast similarity searches and efficient retrieval of related data.
  - Technologies: Pinecone, Weaviate, or FAISS for managing and querying vector data.
5. API Layer
  - Functionality: Facilitates communication between the frontend, chatbot engine, data processing module, and the vector database. Handles HTTP requests and responses.
  - Technologies: Flask or Django REST framework.

### Interfaces Between Components
- Frontend <-> API Layer: The frontend sends user queries and receives responses via RESTful API calls.
- API Layer <-> Chatbot Engine: The API forwards user queries to the chatbot engine and retrieves generated responses.
- API Layer <-> Data Processing Module: The API requests data analysis and market insights from this module.
- Data Processing Module <-> Vector Database: The module writes and reads vector embeddings for efficient querying.
- Chatbot Engine <-> Vector Database: The engine retrieves relevant vector embeddings based on user queries to enhance response accuracy.

### Data Storage
#### Data Organization
- User Data: Stores user profiles, preferences, and interaction history.
- Vector Embeddings: Stores embeddings for stock data, Federal Reserve speeches, and user queries, allowing for similarity searches.
- Raw Data: Historical and real-time stock prices, options data, and text of Federal Reserve speeches.

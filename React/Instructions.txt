General Instructions for running this App:

1. In this directory is a zip file that must be unzipped first to be run.
2. Node.js must be installed and usable, and preferably an environment variable.
3. Open Command Prompt.
4. Use the cd command (change directory) and input the filepath to wherever you extracted the program to, and where you see a package.json file. Example: cd "C:\Users\me\Desktop\everything but modules"
5. Run npm install here, if the node_modules folder does not exist.
6. Ignore the warnings, and then use the command npm start.
7. It should work! It's lacking API functionality, but you can try each feature out.

Note: The plan is to have Python code function as our backend to send API calls, but for now this is a basic program that showcases each feature before this is implemented. It can be run by itself for right now.

        "100KB: Here, shared memory becomes marginally faster (0.000866s) compared to message passing (0.000975s), though the difference is still small. This may be due to the lower overhead in directly accessing shared memory compared to the overhead involved in writing to and reading from a pipe.\n",
        "2. Medium Data Size (1MB):\n",
        "1MB: For this size, shared memory (0.006991s) shows better performance than message passing (0.007599s). The larger the data, the more efficient shared memory becomes because it avoids the overhead of transferring data via pipes, which must split the data into chunks.\n",
        "3. Large Data Size (10MB):\n",
        "10MB: For the largest data size, shared memory (0.067014s) outperforms message passing (0.071361s) even more significantly. As data size increases, the advantage of shared memory becomes clearer. The reason for this is that in shared memory, processes can access the same memory space directly, whereas message passing has to rely on copying data back and forth between processes.\n",

        "Shared Memory Creation:\n",
        "A shared memory segment is created using shmget(), and a pointer is attached to it using shmat(). Both the parent and child access this shared memory segment. Example: shmid = shmget(IPC_PRIVATE, size, IPC_CREAT | 0666) creates a shared memory segment, and shm_ptr = shmat(shmid, NULL, 0) attaches it to the process's address space.\n",

        "Forking: As with message passing, a fork() system call is used to create a child process. Both processes can access the shared memory segment through their pointers.\n",
        "\n",
        "Parent Process:\n",
        "The parent writes data directly to the shared memory using the pointer (memcpy(shm_ptr, data, size)). After the child has written data back, the parent reads the data from shared memory.\n",

        "Child Process:\n",
        "The child reads the data from the shared memory pointer and can modify it or send it back to the parent via shared memory.\n",

        "Pipe Creation:\n",
        "A pipe is created using the pipe() system call. It returns two file descriptors: one for reading and one for writing.\n",
        "Example: pipe(pipe_fd) creates the pipe, with pipe_fd[0] for reading and pipe_fd[1] for writing.\n",

        "\n",
        " Shared memory performs better than message passing as the data size increases, particularly for large data transfers (1MB and above). This is because no data copying between processes is required; both processes directly access the same memory location.\n",
        "Also, Lower overhead is involved because once the memory segment is created and attached, reading/writing to the memory happens in-place.\n",
        "\n",
        "Frequency Impact:\n",
        "The performance of shared memory improves as the frequency of data exchange increases because there’s no extra cost for system calls like read() and write() after memory is mapped.\n",
        "For high-frequency, high-volume data transfers, shared memory is significantly faster.\n",

        "2. Message Passing (via Pipes):\n",
        "\n",
        "Pipes perform efficiently for smaller data sizes, up to 100KB, but become less efficient as the data size increases.\n",
        "Pipes introduce higher overhead for large data transfers because they involve copying data back and forth between processes via the kernel buffer, which takes time. For data sizes like 10MB, message passing via pipes incurs more overhead due to the increased number of chunks that must be written/read between processes.\n",
        "\n",
        "Frequency Impact:\n",
        "When message frequency increases, frequent exchanges of data, pipes incur a performance penalty due to repeated system calls (read() and write()) and context switching between the parent and child processes.\n",
        "As the frequency of messages increases, the overhead of copying data grows, leading to slower performance compared to shared memory."

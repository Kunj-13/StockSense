# StockSense

## Project Idea
This project is aimed at creating a StockSense LLM web application. StockSense LLM is an AI-powered chatbot designed to provide real-time stock market advice. By analyzing data from Federal Reserve speeches, stock data from APIs like yfinance, and stock option data, the chatbot will offer personalized guidance on market trends and trading strategies. Whether the market is bullish or bearish, StockSense will help users make informed decisions by incorporating insights from various financial sources. The goal is to create an interactive tool useful for both novice and experienced traders, with the potential to expand into other financial applications.



## Goals

- Primary Goals:

Interactive AI Chatbot: Develop a chatbot that can handle multiple user requests simultaneously and provide tailored market advice.
Incorporate Federal Reserve Speech Data: Include relevant context from Federal Reserve speeches to inform market guidance.
